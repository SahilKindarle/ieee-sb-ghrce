</strong><strong>Venue: G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur<br />
</strong><strong>Time: 2:30pm to 5:30pm in Various Labs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>         The IEEE SB 62361 organized an event called ‘E-Sports’ which was distributed in two parts first was a seminar on E-Sports which intended to share the knowledge of technology used in E-sports and advancement of technology in this area and the second part was a professional gaming session on the LAN games .</h4>
<h4>          E-sports also known as electronics sports or pro gaming are form of competitions that are facilitated by electronics systems: the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human-computer interfaces. The seminar conducted at GHRCE focused on the history of electronic gaming, technology used in the E-Sports which included specifications mentioned below:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Multi-core processors</li>
<li>3D images and renderings</li>
<li>Heavy-duty graphics cards</li>
<li>Digital image processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event conducted also had LAN gaming which were included with current professional games like CS GO: 1.6 and FIFA15 and the event was an intercollege event and was open for all students across Nagpur in which total 58 students across Nagpur participated in this event.</p>
<p>This event was conducted with motto of enhancing spatial navigation, memory, reasoning and awareness about advancement of technology in the field of E-sports and make the participants aware about graphics development and various technical aspects.</p>

<p><strong>Venue: </strong><strong>G.H.Raisoni College Of Engineering (S-07).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time: </strong><strong>3:30pm to 5:30pm</strong></p>
<h4>        The IEEE SB 62361 organized an event called ‘Floating ideas’ which intended to increase the ability of students to express their ideas and transform them in the form of poster. It was a poster making competition in which students had to present most effective as well as visually attractive poster.</h4>
<p><strong>           </strong>A <em>poster</em> is not just a standard research paper stuck to a board. It is an art to convey your message in the most effective way and tell importance of your message. The event was conducted for the students from all semesters and total 36 students participated in this event. The topics for poster making competition for the participants to show their art, skills and knowledge were as mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>International Human Rights</li>
<li>Demonetization</li>
<li>Music the essence of life</li>
<li>Cashless India</li>
<li>India 2050</li>
</ul>
<p>The posters were judged on the different aspects like creativity, knowledge about the topic, effectiveness and presentation.</p>
<p>The motto behind organizing the ‘Floating Ideas’ was to enhance following aspects among the participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation</li>
<li>Design<em>skills</em></li>
<li>Different presentation context</li>
<li>Developing artistic vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because posters have the ability to stick in viewers&#8217; minds and can be a great tool for small- to medium-sized businesses to use to increase brand awareness.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Date: 14 December 2016</strong><br />
<strong>Day: Wednesday</strong><br />
&#8220;Stage Fear Seminar&#8221; was organized by IEEE Student Branch and CS Chapter GHRCE ( STB- 62361) on 14 December 2016 at 10.30 am. The total number of participants were 24 which included the Core members, Executive members,<br />
Stage fright or performance anxiety is the anxiety, fear, or persistent phobia which may be aroused in an individual by the requirement to perform in front of an audience, whether actually or potentially (for example, when performing before a camera). In the context of public speaking, this may precede or accompany participation in any activity involving public self-presentation. In some cases stage fright may be a part of a larger pattern of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), but many people experience stage fright without any wider problems. Quite often, stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance, often a long time ahead. It has numerous manifestations: stuttering, tachycardia, tremor in the hands and legs, sweaty hands, facial nerve tics, dry mouth, and dizziness</p>
<p>Keeping which in mind we Requested Miss Rutika Meshar to guide the students on the same, also to which there was over wheeling response from the students thus ensuring the students liked it.</p>
<p>About The Trainer<br />
Rutika Meshkar is a life skill trainer and motivational speaker she has been with us for more than 3 years and helps us grooming our life-skill in every way possible</p>
<p>The Seminar was one of the successful and biggest event of IEEE-SB 62361 2016-17,With 24 students attending the seminar and lots of student are requesting to conduct this seminar once again who were not able to attend the seminar due to lectures</p>

<h4>        The IEEE SB 62361 organized an event on mathematics puzzle which intended the students to solve the thirty mathematical puzzles and crack the logic behind every single puzzle. Mathematical puzzles make up an integral part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics">recreational mathematics</a> .These puzzles had some specific rules and the solver had to find a solution that satisfied the given conditions which required mathematics to solve them.</h4>
<p><strong>        </strong>The event was conducted for the students from all semesters and total 51 students participated in this event. The set of questions which were provided to students constrained different mathematical aspects like:</p>
<p>1) Numbers, Arithmetic and algebra.</p>
<p>2) Combinational puzzles.</p>
<p>3) Analytical or Differential.</p>
<p>4) Probability.</p>
<p>The type of puzzles presented were like:</p>
<p>The motto behind organizing the mathematical puzzle was to improve some of technical as well as mathematical aspects between the students mentioned below and to increase the thinking capacity as well as the ability to solve the logical questions.Different aspects are like:<br />
• Meets the Needs of Diverse Learners<br />
• Supports Concept Development in Math<br />
• Encourages Mathematical Reasoning<br />
• Open-Ended (allows for multiple approaches &amp; solutions)<br />
• Improves Basic Skills<br />
• Enhances Number and Operation Sense<br />
• Encourages Strategic Thinking.</p>

<p>The  participants  had to go through mazes of intuited and mind blogging  questions related to electronics  systems, analogical  numericals, circuit design and many more. The format of anatronics entailed three sets of question papers  having  30 mcq on analog circuits and systems.</p>
<p>The intelligent minds answered the questions with enthusiasm, wisdom and confidence, their involvement was remarkable. Quizzes like this helps to assess analog  systems knowledge of the students. Mr Sachin Lute(6<sup>th</sup> semester B.E-ETRX) declared as the winner of anatronics,who gave outstanding  performance in this competition.</p>
<p>G.H.Raisoni College of Engineering  encourages positive competition and hopes to bring out the best in all its students through such competitive events,while ensuring that students learn through all possible ways-not just through books and class-room teaching.</p>
