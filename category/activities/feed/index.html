								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ Event</b></p>
<p><b>Date: </b><b>6</b><b>th</b><b> August, 2016</b></p>
<p><b>Venue: </b><b>Platform Gyan Mandir School</b></p>
<p><b>Time: </b><b>3:00pm to 5:35pm</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In today&#8217;s economic and social environment, issues related to social responsibility and sustainability are gaining more and more importance. Academic goals are inseparable from the societies and environments within which they operate. Whilst short-term economic gain can be pursued, the failure to account for longer-term social and environmental impacts makes those academic practices unsustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Platform Gyan Mandir School founded in June 2010 is affiliated by Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Indian Railways and Nagpur Police. The school’s main objective is to give shelter to vagrant kids and provide proper education to them. There are in total 36 children in the vicinity form 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade to those pursuing Engineering. The school provides proper education to the students as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IEEE’s objective was to inform the students about IEEE and what work it does and make the students enjoy the time with us. We gave an introduction to the students about IEEE, the work IEEE does to make lives better for those who use technology and those who are not fortunate enough to use one, we had a great interactive session with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second, we had planned to make these kids enjoy so that they will forget their home for some time being with us. Well, there were many talented children there. Some of them knew how to break dance, some of them liked to sing and we found a karate player as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we continued our interaction with the students we came across some disheartening stories of how the children had suffered in their short lifespan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them, at the age of 10 was forced to work in a bangle making factory at Jaipur, he detested it.  When he tried to escape from the misery, the authorities attacked him by sticking pieces of glass on his face. That day he ran from the city and started his journey towards Mumbai and in the end ending up in Nagpur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another demoralizing story was of a student who lost his parents on a railway station and all of his credentials were stolen. Nagpur’s Railway authority then sent him at this school to make his life better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were kids from 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> standard who had some or the other tragedies in their life. Some had lost their family members, some treated with cruelty, some getting lost from their family and the list goes on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we found a poet amongst the students who was in Engineering 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> year computer Science branch in Gurunanak Engineering College. He iterated a well written poem in Marathi to us on ‘college life’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">    </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">             </span><span style="font-weight: 400">        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three kids from Assam taught us Assamese as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filled with joy the students of the school wrote the thankyou letter by themselves. The Head Master said something which brightened our day even more, he said, “What is the use of taking photos with me, take photos with the kids. We are just their helpers, nothing more. They need some love, we are trying to get them out of their inferior self and bring out their talents which are hidden in their nutshell. These kids have been through a lot in their small lifetime, we are trying to educate them through our system an make their life better.”</span></p>
<p><b>                  </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We ended our event by giving thme gifts, which included pens, pencils and perks. The kids continued requested us to come soon which we acknowledged. We bid them and the Head Master farewell with many memories installed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">      </span></p>
