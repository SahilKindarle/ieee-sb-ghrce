IEEE stands for advancement of technology for the benefit of humanity, at the same time bringing members access to the industry&#8217;s most essential technical information, networking opportunities, career development tools, and many other exclusive benefits.</p>
<p id="para">To foster an interest in the engineering profession and to tap the latent technical excellence of the youth, IEEE provides for the setting up of Student Branches in technical institutions throughout the world, which provide an active link between the leading innovations and technologies of the present day and the young minds pursuing a career in technical courses.</p>
<p>The IEEE formed in 1963 with the merger of the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers, formed in 1884), and the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers, formed in 1912). From its earliest origins, the IEEE has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced the theory and application of electro technology and allied sciences.</li>
<li>Served as a catalyst for technological innovation</li>
<li>Supported the needs of its members through a wide variety of programs and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through its members, the IEEE is a leading authority in technical areas ranging from computer engineering, biomedical technology and telecommunications, to electric power, aerospace and consumer electronics, among others.</p>
<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is devoted to advancing the theory and application of electrical engineering, electronics, and computing.</p>
