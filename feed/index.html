<h4>        The IEEE SB 62361 organized an event called ‘Floating ideas’ which intended to increase the ability of students to express their ideas and transform them in the form of poster. It was a poster making competition in which students had to present most effective as well as visually attractive poster.</h4>
<p><strong>           </strong>A <em>poster</em> is not just a standard research paper stuck to a board. It is an art to convey your message in the most effective way and tell importance of your message. The event was conducted for the students from all semesters and total 36 students participated in this event. The topics for poster making competition for the participants to show their art, skills and knowledge were as mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>International Human Rights</li>
<li>Demonetization</li>
<li>Music the essence of life</li>
<li>Cashless India</li>
<li>India 2050</li>
</ul>
<p>The posters were judged on the different aspects like creativity, knowledge about the topic, effectiveness and presentation.</p>
<p>The motto behind organizing the ‘Floating Ideas’ was to enhance following aspects among the participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation</li>
<li>Design<em>skills</em></li>
<li>Different presentation context</li>
<li>Developing artistic vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because posters have the ability to stick in viewers&#8217; minds and can be a great tool for small- to medium-sized businesses to use to increase brand awareness.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Date: 14 December 2016</strong><br />
<strong>Day: Wednesday</strong><br />
&#8220;Stage Fear Seminar&#8221; was organized by IEEE Student Branch and CS Chapter GHRCE ( STB- 62361) on 14 December 2016 at 10.30 am. The total number of participants were 24 which included the Core members, Executive members,<br />
Stage fright or performance anxiety is the anxiety, fear, or persistent phobia which may be aroused in an individual by the requirement to perform in front of an audience, whether actually or potentially (for example, when performing before a camera). In the context of public speaking, this may precede or accompany participation in any activity involving public self-presentation. In some cases stage fright may be a part of a larger pattern of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), but many people experience stage fright without any wider problems. Quite often, stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance, often a long time ahead. It has numerous manifestations: stuttering, tachycardia, tremor in the hands and legs, sweaty hands, facial nerve tics, dry mouth, and dizziness</p>
<p>Keeping which in mind we Requested Miss Rutika Meshar to guide the students on the same, also to which there was over wheeling response from the students thus ensuring the students liked it.</p>
<p>About The Trainer<br />
Rutika Meshkar is a life skill trainer and motivational speaker she has been with us for more than 3 years and helps us grooming our life-skill in every way possible</p>
<p>The Seminar was one of the successful and biggest event of IEEE-SB 62361 2016-17,With 24 students attending the seminar and lots of student are requesting to conduct this seminar once again who were not able to attend the seminar due to lectures</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ Event</b></p>
<p><b>Date: </b><b>6</b><b>th</b><b> August, 2016</b></p>
<p><b>Venue: </b><b>Platform Gyan Mandir School</b></p>
<p><b>Time: </b><b>3:00pm to 5:35pm</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In today&#8217;s economic and social environment, issues related to social responsibility and sustainability are gaining more and more importance. Academic goals are inseparable from the societies and environments within which they operate. Whilst short-term economic gain can be pursued, the failure to account for longer-term social and environmental impacts makes those academic practices unsustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Platform Gyan Mandir School founded in June 2010 is affiliated by Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Indian Railways and Nagpur Police. The school’s main objective is to give shelter to vagrant kids and provide proper education to them. There are in total 36 children in the vicinity form 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> grade to those pursuing Engineering. The school provides proper education to the students as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">IEEE’s objective was to inform the students about IEEE and what work it does and make the students enjoy the time with us. We gave an introduction to the students about IEEE, the work IEEE does to make lives better for those who use technology and those who are not fortunate enough to use one, we had a great interactive session with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second, we had planned to make these kids enjoy so that they will forget their home for some time being with us. Well, there were many talented children there. Some of them knew how to break dance, some of them liked to sing and we found a karate player as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we continued our interaction with the students we came across some disheartening stories of how the children had suffered in their short lifespan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them, at the age of 10 was forced to work in a bangle making factory at Jaipur, he detested it.  When he tried to escape from the misery, the authorities attacked him by sticking pieces of glass on his face. That day he ran from the city and started his journey towards Mumbai and in the end ending up in Nagpur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another demoralizing story was of a student who lost his parents on a railway station and all of his credentials were stolen. Nagpur’s Railway authority then sent him at this school to make his life better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were kids from 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> standard who had some or the other tragedies in their life. Some had lost their family members, some treated with cruelty, some getting lost from their family and the list goes on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we found a poet amongst the students who was in Engineering 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> year computer Science branch in Gurunanak Engineering College. He iterated a well written poem in Marathi to us on ‘college life’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">    </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">             </span><span style="font-weight: 400">        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three kids from Assam taught us Assamese as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filled with joy the students of the school wrote the thankyou letter by themselves. The Head Master said something which brightened our day even more, he said, “What is the use of taking photos with me, take photos with the kids. We are just their helpers, nothing more. They need some love, we are trying to get them out of their inferior self and bring out their talents which are hidden in their nutshell. These kids have been through a lot in their small lifetime, we are trying to educate them through our system an make their life better.”</span></p>
<p><b>                  </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We ended our event by giving thme gifts, which included pens, pencils and perks. The kids continued requested us to come soon which we acknowledged. We bid them and the Head Master farewell with many memories installed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">      </span></p>
